# Tutorial Edge Go REST API Part 1

This is the code from following along with the https://tutorialedge.net/courses/go-rest-api-course through the fist two parts of the course.

* Project Setup and Structure
* Implementing the Comment Service

The code includes some minor refactoring that I added to understand the code and to cover alternate use cases.
